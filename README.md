## General Information
This project aims to develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to accurately detect melanoma, a severe type of skin cancer responsible for 75% of skin cancer deaths. Early detection is essential, as timely intervention can significantly improve outcomes. By creating an image classification model that identifies melanoma in skin images, this project could assist dermatologists in speeding up diagnoses and reducing manual analysis efforts.

## Conclusions
Performance: While the model demonstrates strong training accuracy, the significant gap in validation accuracy suggests overfitting, where the model fails to generalize beyond training data.
Overfitting Mitigation: Techniques such as data augmentation, dropout, and regularization should be considered to improve the model's robustness on unseen data.
Model Complexity: Simplifying the model or tuning hyperparameters might reduce overfitting, enabling it to generalize better.
Future Enhancements: Additional data or more diverse data augmentation techniques might further improve the model's effectiveness in identifying melanoma.
